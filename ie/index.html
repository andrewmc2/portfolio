<div id="about">
	<div class="heading1" id="computerLanguages">About</div>
	<p class="black-bg-text">I guess you could say that I'm a well traveled guy with a rather unique experience. After graduating from McGill with a degree in Economics, I packed my bags and moved to Beijing, where I spent  a few years working on major entertainment co-productions between China and USA and becoming a fluent Mandarin speaker. Currently I am completing a post-grad degree in Interactive Multimedia at Sheridan College, where I'm learning to build create, manage and develop web and mobile content in various emerging technologies. My passion lies in mobile development, which includes both native iOS app development and responsive web design (like this site!). I love coding, and hope we can work together to make your web/mobile idea become a reality. 
	
I am familiar with HTML5/CS3, Javascript/jQuery, Objective-C/Xcode, Flash/Actionscript, PHP, and Adobe CS6.

			<div class="heading2">Retro Rooster</div>
				<div class="project-image"><img src="images/projects/1-retro/retro1.png" /></div>
					<p class="white-bg-text">Retro Rooster is a native iOS application written in Objective-C that puts a gamification spin on the traditional alarm clock. When the alarm goes off, the user can either snooze or ‘shake to wake'. Once the iPhone is shaken, the user will have to play a mini-game using accelerometer control and gestures to prove that their brain is awake. This is my first native iOs app and hopefully it will be in the App Store soon.</p>

			<div class="heading2">Mess with Mitt</div>
		<div class="project-image"><img src="images/projects/2-mitt/mitt1.jpg" /></div>
					<p class="white-bg-text">Mess with Mitt combines an Arduino, Flash, a solenoid, an infrared motion sensor, silly spray, and everyone's favorite politician, Mitt Romney. In this project, it's the year 2050 and the user must interact with Mitt to help him make cash to fund his expensive robot body. If the user succeeds, Mitt is happy. But if the user makes the wrong moves, they will trigger the solenoid and get sprayed.</p>

			<div class="heading2">Morning Bird</div>
				<div class="project-image"><img src="images/projects/3-mb/mb1.png" /></div>
				<p class="white-bg-text">Morning Bird is a web application built with Drupal with a custom module that can access and control the Twilio SMS API. The goal of this application is to ‘wake the brain' of the user by asking them stimulating trivia questions in the form of SMS messages. The user can set these times and also control the difficulty and subject of the trivia questions. This application was done in conjunction with my Fellowship program at Myplanet Digital where I played a duel role of front-end developer and product owner.</p>

This project was not only a website, but also a simulation to pitch an idea to a possible investor. The final project included front end dev and design and a Keynote pitch.</p>
